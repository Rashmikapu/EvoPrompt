This is an implementation of the paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14838

This was implemented as the first part of the project whose report can be seen in report.pdf

--> Evoprompting on MNIST-1d dataset : /mnist1d/Evoprompt.ipynb

--> Evoprompting on Cifar10 : /Cifar/Evoprompt_cifar.ipynb

Follow the instructions in the .ipynb file to add paths for seeds directory.
Adjust the parameters p,k,m,n,T as required.

Generate an OpenAI API key and update it in the code.

Part of the code has been inspired by the following work:
